The ID3 algorithm is implemented using Python. The implementation supports random pruning of decision tree according to pruning factor, 

To run this code:
1. In you terminal, type "python ID3.py"
2. You will be asked to input the full path to the training_set, validation_set, test_set and pruning factor
(Please make sure that you input the correct path to your dataset)
(Pruning factor in the range of 0.0 to 0.15 has been test in this implementation)
